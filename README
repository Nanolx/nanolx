Nanolx
=======================================

About
=======================================

Nanolx is a set of meta-packages, wich I use to aid in syncing the package
selection between my machine and machines that are maintained by me.

They can be safely used by anyone on official Debian as they won't remove
or change existing packages.

Some meta-packages also provide additional scripts, tools and configs.

Installation on Debian GNU/Linux
=======================================

First install nanolx-apt-sources on it's own, then issue apt-getkeys.
Afterwards continue with the other nanolx-* packages as usual.
