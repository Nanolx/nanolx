Nanolx
=======================================

About
=======================================

Nanolx is a set of meta-packages, wich I use to aid in syncing the package
selection between my machine and machines that are maintained by me.

They can be safely used by anyone on official Debian as they won't remove
or change existing packages.

Some meta-packages also provide additional scripts, tools and configs.

Installation on Debian GNU/Linux
=======================================

First install the

	nanolx-apt-sources

package on it's own, then issue

	apt-getkeys

as root. Afterwards continue with the other nanolx-* packages, as desired.

The apt singing key for my photonic apt repository is located at

	http://www.nanolx.org/apt/photonic.asc
