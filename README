Nanolx
=======================================

About
=======================================

Nanolx is not a complete distribution nor a fork of Debian GNU/Linux.

It's more what I think Debian should be, this meta-packages are used to
aid me in syncing the package selection between my machine and machines
that are maintained by me. They can be safely used by anyone on official
Debian as they won't remove or change existing packages.

Some meta-packages also provide additional scripts, tools and configs.

Installation on Debian GNU/Linux
=======================================

First install nanolx-apt-sources on it's own, then issue apt-getkeys.
Afterwards continue with the other nanolx-* packages as usual.
